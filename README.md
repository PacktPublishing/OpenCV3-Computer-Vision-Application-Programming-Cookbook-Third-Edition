# OpenCV 3 Computer Vision Application Programming Cookbook, Third Edition
This is the code repository for [OpenCV 3 Computer Vision Application Programming Cookbook, Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/opencv-3-computer-vision-application-programming-cookbook-third-edition?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786469717), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

# About the Book
OpenCV 3 Computer Vision Application Programming Cookbook Third Edition provides a complete introduction to the OpenCV library and explains how to build your first computer vision program. You will be presented with a variety of computer vision algorithms and exposed to important concepts in image and video analysis that will enable you to build your own computer vision applications.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
// Compute Laplacian using LaplacianZC class
LaplacianZC laplacian;
laplacian.setAperture(7); // 7x7 laplacian
cv::Mat flap= laplacian.computeLaplacian(image);
laplace= laplacian.getLaplacianImage();

```

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-14)
